<h3><span>not everything on this website is mine, only the searching thing was made from scratch. (credits to the creator of lucid)
</span>
  
<span>  this was mostly made by only me @RebeccaHuang3 also known as FeetusAndRatEater or something like that                      </span>

  <span>i made this due to school securly and things always blocking websites in hopes that i can go on them one day. they includingly blocked the rammerhead websites and ultraviolet including things that have about:blank as its URL.                          </span>

  <span>this unblocker i made might be a tad bit slow and there are chances of the school blocking some parts of websites you try to use.                     
  </span>

  ENJOY!
